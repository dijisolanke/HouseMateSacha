<h1>More About</h1>

<h4>
This is a commercial website made using bespoke code.
It has a six pages, four for viewing the products on sale (Hand made glass sculptures by a French artist named Sacha Delabre), a bio section and a check out page which uses PHP to process a form and send an automated image to both client and owner with relevant information on product request.

No financial transactions actually take place on the site however, as I hadn’t yet learned enough about web security and didn’t want to take any unnecessary risks.
